# Neural Network Charity Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
    - The purpose of the analysis is to use historical data from Alphabet Soup in order to help the organisation determine whether or not future grants to prospective applicants will  be successful. we are using a binary classifier to do that.

## Results
### Data Preprocessing:
    - The target variables are those where the money was used effectively    
    - The features are all applications types
    - The variables that were neither targets nor features are the identification  names and numbers

### Compiling, Training and Evaluating the Model:
    - Neurons input = 1, and output = 1; Layers = 2 and Optimized = 3; Activation functions are ReLU and Sigmoid
    - Yes, my optimized model achieved a predictive accuracy of 77.8%
    - I used 30 epochs
